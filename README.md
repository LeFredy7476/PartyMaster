# PartyMaster
A "simple" party game web app for a school project.

## Features

Our project aims to provide the following 
functionalities:

### Expendable game librairy

The logic used in our server will be made in a way
that we can easily append our library with more
games without difficulties.

### Ease of use and seemingless first time

In order to make the application user-friendly and
simplifying the experiences of new player. The 
features on the app will be available without any 
needs to create an account. A temporary uuid will 
be assigned automatically to every player that join 
our server.

### Smooth and stylish UI

The application will be presented in a bold cartoony
style without using any kinds off ui framework.

players to communicate between them.
